Apply Design Thinking approach and methods to conceptualize solutions aiming to solve complex problems\n2. Apply advanced digital and physical prototyping tools to materialize proposed concepts\n3. Present and apply approaches for concept selection and prototype testing with end users \n4. Develop concepts generated previously to complete working prototypes \n5. Prepare and deliver presentations of the proposed solutions for users, potential partners, and general public\n6. Screen Intellectual Property (IP) databases and analyze prototypes' potencial for IP and to elaborate detailed description of IP request", "programa_resumido": "In this course, students apply design thinking and user centered design approaches throughout the course in order to develop a working prototype. There is a strong focus on advanced prototyping.\n\nThis discipline contributes to the development of the following course competencies:\nCompetency 1 \u2013 Analyze physical phenomena with the aid of models\nCompetency 3 \u2013 Manage the implementation of engineering solutions\nCompetency 6 \u2013 Research, innovate, and entrepreneurship\n\nAnd the following related skills:\n402. Understand and apply techniques for designing products, services, and businesses;\n502. Design and make feasible the production of products, services, and businesses;\n409-509. Understand the concepts and methods of project management to plan, execute, and control engineering and management projects;\n205-504. Understand and apply the fundamentals of engineering (mechanical, chemical, electrical, structures, and materials) in solving engineering and management problems.", "turmas": [{"codigo": "2025101", "inicio": "24/02/2025", "fim": "07/07/2025", "tipo": "Te\u00f3rica", "horario": [{"dia": "sab", "inicio": "14:00", "fim": "16:00", "professores": ["(R) Andr\u00e9 Leme Fleury", "(R) Eduardo de Senzi Zancul"]}], "vagas": {"Obrigat\u00f3ria": {"vagas": 0, "inscritos": 0, "pendentes": 0, "matriculados": 0, "grupos": {}}, "Optativa Livre": {"vagas": 15, "inscritos": 4, "pendentes": 0, "matriculados": 0, "grupos": {"Qualquer Unidade da USP": {"vagas": 15, "inscritos": 0, "pendentes": 0, "matriculados": 0}}}}}]}
