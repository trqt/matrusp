Geophysics provides a range of approaches to image parts of the subsurface which are otherwise inaccessible. Such methods are used extensively in civil engineering and resource-related industries, and for environmental investigation and monitoring. The unit teaches concepts underlying geophysical surveying, and shows how it is used in a real-world context.", "programa_resumido": "The unit will cover geophysical surveying using gravity...", "turmas": []}
