Particularly, the general theory of law has faced the transformation of basic and standard categories within the legal system, experiencing the genesis of new forms and instruments of legal liability and sanctioning; new models of normative texture (that go beyond the hard and soft law opposition, to encompass models of mixt law), interpretation and enforcement. Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms have been developed, always with less attachment to state aims of retribution, than the restoration perspective, on the one hand; and always with the purpose to establish alternative instruments of accountability, more attached to the emerging mechanism of Smart Regulation, by another side. The Course is aimed at interdisciplinarity and will foster graduates and researchers to deal with new fields of legal knowledge.", "programa_resumido": "1.
