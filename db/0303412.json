Present and apply approaches for prototype testing with users \n4. Define final materials and production processes \n5. Research and analyze potential to register Intellectual Property\n6. Elaborate detailed description of Intellectual Property aiming to patent file\n7 Define potential business model for the solution\n8. Identify and detail potential partnerships and alternatives for market introduction\n9. Prepare and deliver presentations of the proposed solutions for users, potential partners, and general public", "programa_resumido": "In this course, students develop a previous concept to a real working product prototype. There is a strong focus on advanced prototyping in order to bring product closer to final solution. Students also work to define potential business model and alternatives for market introduction.\n\nThis discipline contributes to the development of the following course competencies:\nCompetency 1 \u2013 Analyze physical phenomena with the aid of models\nCompetency 3 \u2013 Manage the implementation of engineering solutions\nCompetency 6 \u2013 Research, innovate, and entrepreneurship\n\nAnd the following related skills:\n402. Understand and apply techniques for designing products, services, and businesses;\n502. Design and make feasible the production of products, services, and businesses;\n409-509. Understand the concepts and methods of project management to plan, execute, and control engineering and management projects;\n205-504. Understand and apply the fundamentals of engineering (mechanical, chemical, electrical, structures, and materials) in solving engineering and management problems.", "turmas": [{"codigo": "2025101", "inicio": "24/02/2025", "fim": "07/07/2025", "tipo": "Te\u00f3rica", "horario": [{"dia": "sab", "inicio": "16:00", "fim": "18:00", "professores": ["(R) Andr\u00e9 Leme Fleury", "(R) Eduardo de Senzi Zancul"]}], "vagas": {"Obrigat\u00f3ria": {"vagas": 0, "inscritos": 0, "pendentes": 0, "matriculados": 0, "grupos": {}}, "Optativa Livre": {"vagas": 15, "inscritos": 4, "pendentes": 0, "matriculados": 0, "grupos": {"Qualquer Unidade da USP": {"vagas": 15, "inscritos": 0, "pendentes": 0, "matriculados": 0}}}}}]}
